## Requirements
<ul>
<li> When the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and the user is presented with a question</li>
<li> When the user selects an answer to the question</li>
<ul>
<li> They are presented with another question</li>
<li> They are told if they answered the previous question correctly or not</li>
<li> If they answered incorrectly, time is deducted from the timer</li>
</ul>
<li> When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over</li>
<li> When the game is over, the user can save their initials and score</li>
<ul><li> NOTE: I changed this so that if the game is over because the time ran out, the user's score is not saved.</li></ul>
<li> NOTE About Answer Feedback: The mockup shows the feedback as "Wrong!" or "Correct!" below the answers. It looks like the feedback applies to the user's response to the question currently displayed, but it's actually to the previous question. I changed the wording to be "Your previous answer was Correct/Wrong!" (as appropriate).</li>
<li> NOTE About the "Go Back" button: The "Go Back" button on the high scores screen in the mock up is ambiguous - does it "go back" to the last question? Or does it go back to the start of the quiz? Or does it go back to the initial greeting? I've made it go back to the initial greeting, and I've changed the name to "Start Over".</li>
<li> NOTE About the quiz questions: I used the questions from the mockup and then added a few more from
